IT

In IT this lesson we looked at how our blogs could be customized using the style.scss folder.

How did you do it?

I did it by finding an image I liked on the internet and clicked view image. After that I was able to copy and paste the url into the background part so it can be used in my blog.

After clicking save changes and refreshing my blog multiple times then it will look nice.
